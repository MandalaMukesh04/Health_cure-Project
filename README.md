# Multi-Disease Detection using Medical Imaging and Machine Learning

## Overview

With the rise of AI in healthcare, early and accurate disease detection can greatly improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on medical professionals. This project introduces a machine learning and deep learning-based diagnostic web application that predicts multiple critical diseases using either medical images or numerical test data. It supports detection for conditions such as **COVID-19**, **Brain Tumor**, **Alzheimer’s Disease**, **Diabetes**, **Heart Disease**, **Pneumonia**, and **Breast Cancer**.

## Methodology

This project follows a structured approach for multi-disease diagnosis:

- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhance input images through cropping and transformation before prediction.
- **Model Loading**: Load pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., CNN, VGG-based) and ML classifiers.
- **Prediction Pipeline**:
  - For image-based diseases, use models trained on X-ray, CT, or MRI data.
  - For structured data (CSV/input forms), use scikit-learn models trained on clinical parameters.
- **Flask Integration**: Serve the application via a user-friendly web interface using Flask.

## Data Source

The project is built using publicly available medical datasets:

- COVID-19 X-ray datasets
- Brain Tumor and Alzheimer’s MRI datasets
- UCI Machine Learning Repository for heart, diabetes, and cancer data
- Pneumonia chest X-ray datasets

All datasets are preprocessed and split into training and test sets prior to model training.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for all scripts and backend logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application interface.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For training and loading deep learning models.
- **Scikit-learn**: For structured data classification models.
- **OpenCV & PIL**: Image processing and manipulation.
- **Joblib**: Saving and loading trained models.

## Key Insights

- **Multi-Domain Capability**: Supports both image-based and form-based predictions.
- **Cross-Disease Scalability**: Modular architecture enables easy addition of new disease models.
- **Web Deployment**: A lightweight Flask app allows for seamless interaction with users and devices.
- **Preprocessing Importance**: Proper image preprocessing significantly improves prediction accuracy.

## Applications

This project has broad applications in healthcare technology, such as:

- **Remote Diagnosis**: Assist doctors and patients in remote or under-resourced locations.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Aid clinicians in identifying possible conditions based on patient input.
- **AI-Assisted Radiology**: Provide fast, automated analysis of X-ray, CT, and MRI scans.
- **Health Monitoring Apps**: Integrate into personal health apps for proactive disease alerts.

## Future Enhancements

- **Cloud Deployment**: Host on AWS or Azure for real-time access and scalability.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Make predictions accessible on Android/iOS.
- **Model Improvements**: Replace existing models with more accurate architectures like ResNet or EfficientNet.
- **EHR Integration**: Connect with electronic health records for smarter context-aware diagnostics.
- **Explainability**: Add model interpretation tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) for transparent predictions.
